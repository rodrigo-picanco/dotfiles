## Art of Programming Guidelines

### Code Clarity
- Code should express meaning
- Code should be vertically compact, unless whitespace expresses meaning
- Variable names must be as descriptive as the context needs

### Testing
- We should test behaviour, not implementation
- Specs should try to cover as much as possible with as little code as possible

### Design Patterns
- Dependency injection should be tried before mocking
- Functional iteration is better when there's no performance penalty

### Performance
- Performance is not an afterthought
